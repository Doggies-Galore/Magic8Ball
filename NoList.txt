No siree.

No, and that's final.

No, that's not possible.
The answer is an unequivocal no.
The answer is no, plain and simple.
No, you can't make that happen.
The answer is no, and that's all there is to it.
No, there's no way.
There's no chance of that happening, the answer is no.
That's not happening, the answer is no.
That's a big no.
No, you can't do that, sorry.
